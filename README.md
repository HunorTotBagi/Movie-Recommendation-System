This is a movie recommendation algorithm that uses regular expressions to clean movie titles and remove any characters that are not letters, digits, or spaces. It then creates a Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) matrix and takes the log of the values. The algorithm also uses the "ngram_range" parameter to look for not only individual words in the title, but also consecutive pairs of words to improve accuracy. The algorithm then creates a search function that calculates the similarity between the entered movie and all of the movies in the list using cosine similarity. The algorithm also uses movie ratings data set to find similar movies based on user preferences and recommend movies that were liked by over 10% of similar users, and creates a recommendation score by comparing the percentages of users who recommend each movie.
